This was my application to Shopify's 2022 Front-end Web Development Summer Internship program. I used <a href="https://threejs.org">Three.js</a> for the stars on the landing page, and a minor parallax effect for the hero banner on the gallery page.

Having the camera pan through infinite stars was a bit of an issue memory-wise, so I just had the camera reset to the start once it reached a certain position.
